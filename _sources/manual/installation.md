# Installation

## Requirements

*JaxILI* is powered with `JAX` but also uses external libraries such as *Tensorflow* and *PyTorch*.

It is recommended to install *JaxILI* in an independant environment or to use the Docker Image to avoid breaking dependencies with those libraries.

## Install the current release

To install the current release of *JaxILI*, use pip:

```bash
$ pip install jaxili
```
